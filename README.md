## What is Home Control?

Home control is a web application aimed to help with your household's accountings. You can classify your spenditures in categories that suit your needs and then add each transaction as you see fit. Home Control allows you to keep tabs on what you spend your money on, and provide nice graphs to help visualize where your money is going.

## State of Development

Home Control is currently under development as a personal project. There's no live demo of what's available right now.
